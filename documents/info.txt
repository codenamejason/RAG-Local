RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a powerful AI technique that combines the best of both worlds: information retrieval and text generation.

Key Components:
1. Retrieval: The system searches through a knowledge base to find relevant information
2. Augmentation: The retrieved information is used to enhance the AI's response
3. Generation: The AI generates a comprehensive answer based on the retrieved context

Benefits:
- More accurate and up-to-date responses
- Ability to cite sources and provide evidence
- Reduced hallucination compared to pure language models
- Can work with domain-specific knowledge

This system uses:
- OpenAI embeddings for semantic search
- ChromaDB for vector storage
- Claude 3 Haiku for text generation
- Smart document chunking with overlap
