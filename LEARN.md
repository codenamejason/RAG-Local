# RAG Learning Roadmap

## How to ACTUALLY Learn From This Code

Since you want to learn, let's make this worth your time. Here's what you should do:

### 1. Break Things On Purpose (2-3 hours)
- Change the chunk size to 50, then 2000. See what breaks.
- Remove the overlap. Watch retrieval quality tank.
- Switch from Voyage to a basic TF-IDF vectorizer. Compare results.
- Use GPT-3.5 instead of Claude. Notice the difference.

**Why?** You'll understand WHY each component matters, not just THAT it exists.

### 2. Build Each Component From Scratch (1-2 days)
- Write your own chunking function without looking at mine
- Implement cosine similarity search without ChromaDB
- Create your own embedding cache to save API costs
- Build a simple reranker for the retrieved chunks

**Why?** Copy-paste teaches you nothing. Building teaches you everything.

### 3. Solve These Specific Challenges (1 week)

#### Challenge 1: Make it handle tables and structured data properly
- Current chunking destroys table context
- Figure out how to preserve structure

#### Challenge 2: Add memory/conversation history
- Current system has no memory between queries
- Implement conversation-aware retrieval

#### Challenge 3: Build evaluation metrics
- How do you know if your RAG is good?
- Implement retrieval precision/recall
- Measure answer quality programmatically

#### Challenge 4: Optimize for cost
- Current implementation could cost $100s/day at scale
- Add caching, batching, and smart retrieval

### 4. The Real Learning Projects

Instead of generic RAG, build these specific variations:

#### Project A: Code Documentation RAG
- Index a GitHub repo
- Answer questions about the codebase
- Generate documentation from code

#### Project B: Research Paper RAG
- Handle LaTeX/PDF papers
- Preserve equations and citations
- Generate literature reviews

#### Project C: Customer Support RAG
- Index support tickets and solutions
- Route queries to right answers
- Learn from feedback loops

## The Learning Metrics That Matter

Stop measuring learning by "did it run?" Start measuring by:

1. **Can you explain every line to a junior developer?**
2. **Can you debug it without Stack Overflow?**
3. **Can you optimize it for 10x scale?**
4. **Can you adapt it to a completely different use case?**

## Your Learning Homework

**Tonight:** Delete my code. Try to rebuild the core RAG loop from memory. You'll fail. That's good. Figure out why.

**This Week:** Pick ONE component (embeddings, chunking, or retrieval) and become an expert. Read 3 papers. Implement 2 alternatives. Benchmark them.

**This Month:** Build a RAG system for something you ACTUALLY care about. Your notes, your bookmarks, your code, whatever. Use it daily. Fix what annoys you.

## The Brutal Truth About Learning

Right now you're a **tutorial tourist** - visiting other people's code, taking photos, going home unchanged.

Real learning happens when you:
- Build without tutorials
- Debug without answers
- Optimize without guides
- Ship without hand-holding

The code I gave you is training wheels. The question is: when are you taking them off?
